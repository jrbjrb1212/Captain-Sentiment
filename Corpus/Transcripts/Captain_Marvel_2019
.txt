i	remember	that	name	of	your	first	what	i	do	i	not	first	straight	out	of	high	left	the	ranks	
a	full	bird	it	was	the	cold	we	were	i	like	the	i	can	make	them	been	riding	a	desk	
for	the	past	six	trying	to	figure	out	where	our	future	enemies	are	coming	never	occurred	to	me	they	would	
be	coming	from	name	a	detail	so	bizarre	a	skrull	could	never	fabricate	if	toast	is	cut	i	eat	you	
need	did	i	but	i	enjoyed	your	prove	not	a	and	how	is	that	supposed	to	prove	to	me	not	
a	a	photon	a	skrull	do	a	full	bird	colonel	turned	spy	turned	must	have	pretty	high	security	the	skrulls	
sim	alien	races	to	infiltrate	and	take	over	and	a	a	race	of	noble	noble	warrior	what	do	skrulls	want	
with	they	believe	that	she	developed	a	engine	at	gotta	not	the	craziest	thing	heard	still	and	what	do	you	
to	stop	the	skrulls	before	they	become	is	a	universal	i	know	a	rogue	soldier	when	i	see	you	got	
a	personal	stake	in	this	is	government	turn	your	vehicle	nicholas	joseph	agent	of	place	your	thumb	on	the	one	
nicholas	joseph	you	have	three	everybody	calls	me	not	not	not	just	what	does	your	mom	call	what	do	you	
call	what	about	your	if	i	have	call	me	you	are	cleared	for	thank	hold	you	look	like	disaffected	put	
that	what	is	the	announcing	your	identity	on	clothing	help	with	the	covert	part	of	your	said	the	space	soldier	
who	was	wearing	a	rubber	lose	the	how	can	i	help	agents	of	looking	for	a	woman	named	a	wendy	
do	you	know	follow	you	familiar	with	the	phrase	this	is	that	a	who	are	you	my	i	mention	after	
you	should	see	what	i	can	do	with	a	how	are	my	look	at	just	look	at	you	the	cutest	
little	you	and	your	your	cool	name	for	a	cool	be	let	me	get	my	fingerprint	just	let	me	unravel	
this	you	sat	there	and	watched	me	play	with	when	all	you	had	to	do	i	wanna	steal	your	plan	
for	the	i	wonder	why	they	terminated	the	maybe	because	kree	lawson	is	not	she	crashed	the	asis	aircraft	doing	
an	unauthorized	test	took	a	pilot	down	with	why	security	here	is	so	covering	up	a	and	your	engine	is	
when	did	this	crash	six	years	who	was	the	most	of	this	but	there	is	a	testimonial	here	from	a	
maria	last	person	to	see	them	you	back	in	a	this	about	fighting	about	ending	i	know	lawson	was	she	
was	here	on	and	died	in	a	plane	do	you	know	anything	about	i	just	discovered	a	mission	report	sent	
from	only	so	much	cleared	to	tell	lawson	was	an	undercover	kree	operative	named	she	was	working	on	a	unique	
energy	experimenting	with	tech	that	apparently	could	help	us	win	the	she	still	cooperating	with	the	you	men	stay	i	
want	to	question	her	excellent	does	it	say	anything	about	anything	about	of	course	why	would	i	found	evidence	that	
i	had	a	life	on	is	who	i	see	when	i	visit	the	supreme	i	knew	and	i	knew	her	
as	this	sounds	like	skrull	because	i	i	was	remember	your	know	your	it	could	be	do	not	let	your	
emotions	override	your	on	sublevel	get	off	on	and	take	the	stairs	in	case	she	makes	a	run	for	do	
a	pincer	move	like	we	did	in	like	we	did	in	nearing	the	jump	leave	your	beacon	on	so	i	
can	find	get	to	the	bottom	of	colluding	with	the	then	why	would	he	call	us	all	i	know	is	
we	take	him	dead	or	dead	or	was	it	something	i	you	i	really	need	these	to	but	they	do	
kinda	complete	the	you	you	called	them	my	do	you	have	eyes	on	not	down	try	up	your	you	obviously	
be	trusted	with	do	you	know	how	to	fly	this	a	yes	or	no	what	talking	we	got	a	hang	
a	good	a	good	you	the	good	see	anyone	you	funny	i	arrived	on	hala	near	no	that	was	six	
years	you	think	the	pilot	that	went	down	with	saying	the	last	person	to	see	them	alive	could	probably	tell	
maria	how	do	we	get	to	due	hang	a	right	at	that	that	stopped	the	skrulls	from	finding	the	new	
i	guess	he	hate	me	give	him	i	guess	he	had	a	you	went	with	his	gut	against	a	really	
hard	thing	to	but	what	keeps	us	i	get	in	trouble	for	a	i	can	see	that	about	rescuing	the	
guy	who	sold	you	out	to	the	guessing	not	standard	kree	operating	i	tell	your	boss	if	you	tell	the	
accusers	completed	their	but	the	greater	mission	was	a	thanks	to	your	it	was	a	trap	to	lure	our	operative	
vers	to	torfa	and	kidnap	give	us	their	take	care	of	the	by	them	out	of	the	handle	a	cell	
of	skrulls	anywhere	is	a	threat	to	kree	where	are	they	they	are	lost	for	but	we	will	find	do	
or	we	maintain	the	course	for	excuse	looking	for	maria	auntie	auntie	i	knew	everyone	said	you	were	but	we	
knew	they	were	not	really	who	you	think	i	that	is	the	craziest	shit	i	ever	green	transforming	no	such	
you	are	absolutely	young	there	is	no	such	if	there	we	would	want	to	keep	that	to	you	believe	no	
so	she	can	do	a	lot	more	than	make	tea	with	those	like	show	maybe	i	kept	all	your	go	
get	you	want	to	give	her	a	hand	with	you	remember	i	see	little	but	i	tell	if	i	could	
just	piece	together	what	happened	that	maybe	all	make	you	woke	me	up	banging	on	my	door	at	your	usual	
back	we	had	to	get	up	so	the	air	force	still	letting	women	fly	so	testing	planes	was	our	only	
at	doing	something	that	you	wanted	to	race	to	base	in	your	old	and	i	about	to	i	knew	my	
camaro	would	but	you	took	a	since	when	is	a	shortcut	since	it	violates	the	predetermined	rules	of	i	definitely	
remember	of	course	you	when	i	got	to	the	lawson	was	she	said	she	had	lives	to	she	was	trying	
to	take	the	asis	up	but	you	said	if	there	were	lives	at	i	would	fly	the	big	hero	the	
kind	of	moment	both	been	waiting	the	doc	was	always	why	we	liked	but	now	saying	from	another	i	know	
this	must	be	hard	for	this	part	right	hard	is	losing	my	best	in	a	mission	so	secret	they	act	
like	it	never	even	hard	is	knowing	you	were	out	there	somewhere	too	damn	stubborn	to	and	now	you	come

what	to	end	but	the	wars	are	bigger	than	you	damn	my	name	is	not	my	real	name	is	and	
i	come	from	a	planet	called	i	would	say	that	but	we	just	got	down	by	a	spaceship	and	your	
is	i	spent	half	my	life	fighting	a	shameful	skedaddle	before	you	give	me	any	more	just	remember	the	you	
gotta	save	without	save	now	i	gotta	blow	this	engine	before	they	find	what	are	you	we	have	no	interest	
in	hurting	all	the	kinda	gave	me	the	wrong	the	energy	where	is	on	the	you	have	two	minutes	until	
then	i	see	no	reason	to	prolong	this	you	mean	that	energy	still	permission	to	hold	your	nothing	the	core	
has	been	she	absorbed	its	coming	with	he	lied	to	everything	that	i	knew	was	a	you	what	do	i	
understand	he	she	found	out	that	she	was	on	the	wrong	side	of	an	unjust	your	people	are	they	i	
saw	the	ruins	on	ruins	that	the	accusers	are	responsible	my	people	lived	as	refugees	on	ever	since	we	resisted	
kree	and	they	destroyed	our	and	the	handful	of	us	that	are	left	will	be	slaughtered	unless	you	help	me	
finish	what	the	core	that	she	found	would	have	powered	a	capable	of	carrying	us	to	a	new	home	where	
the	kree	reach	lawson	always	told	us	that	our	work	at	pegasus	to	fight	but	to	end	she	wanted	you	
to	help	us	find	the	i	already	destroyed	you	destroyed	the	the	core	that	powered	it	is	in	a	remote	
if	you	help	us	decode	those	we	can	find	use	it	to	destroy	we	just	want	a	you	and	i	
lost	everything	at	the	hands	of	the	you	see	it	not	one	of	you	know	you	have	no	idea	who	
i	i	even	know	who	i	you	are	carol	you	are	the	woman	on	that	black	box	risking	her	life	
to	do	the	right	my	best	who	supported	me	as	a	mother	and	a	pilot	when	no	one	else	you	
are	and	and	a	huge	pain	in	the	and	you	were	the	most	powerful	person	i	way	before	you	could	
fire	from	your	you	hear	do	you	hear	come	come	i	got	i	know	i	deserve	your	but	you	were	
our	only	we	discovered	that	your	energy	signature	matched	now	we	know	if	only	you	knew	the	importance	of	it	
to	i	just	need	your	help	decoding	the	coordinates	to	those	state	for	orbital	position	and	you	find	her	lab	
on	not	on	that	was	the	location	on	the	date	of	the	crash	six	years	if	we	track	its	find	
it	in	orbit	right	just	basic	in	was	that	so	difficult	to	figure	i	my	science	will	catch	up	to	
me	got	to	get	to	the	core	before	he	going	to	in	a	few	tweaks	to	your	vessel	should	do	
i	can	handle	the	your	science	i	could	use	a	i	i	leave	i	can	stay	with	gramma	and	no	
way	too	testing	aerospace	tech	is	and	you	used	to	do	your	plan	is	to	leave	the	atmosphere	in	a	
craft	not	designed	for	the	and	you	anticipate	hostile	with	a	foreign	what	you	have	to	you	have	a	chance	
to	fly	the	coolest	mission	in	the	history	of	and	gonna	give	it	up	to	sit	on	the	couch	and
