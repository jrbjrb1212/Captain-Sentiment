specific	selections	from	my	it	was	my	understanding	that	i	was	going	to	be	testifying	in	a	much	more	comprehensive	
and	detailed	i	a	lot	of	things	have	changed	so	if	you	could	just	you	do	understand	that	reading	a	
single	paragraph	out	of	context	does	not	reflect	the	summary	of	my	just	read	i	thank	very	he	does	not	
operate	within	any	definable	branch	of	man	presents	a	potential	threat	to	the	security	of	both	the	to	her	i	
go	on	to	summarise	that	the	benefits	of	iron	man	far	outweigh	the	and	that	it	would	be	in	our	
to	fold	into	the	existing	chain	of	not	a	but	consider	secretary	of	if	you	ask	we	can	amend	the	
hours	a	little	like	to	go	on	and	if	i	the	imagery	connected	to	your	i	believe	it	is	somewhat	
premature	to	reveal	these	images	to	the	general	public	at	this	with	all	due	i	and	if	you	could	just	
narrate	those	for	be	very	have	the	intelligence	suggests	that	the	devices	seen	in	these	photos	in	attempts	at	making	
manned	copies	of	this	has	been	corroborated	by	our	allies	and	local	intelligence	on	the	indicating	that	these	suits	are	
quite	at	this	hold	on	one	let	me	see	something	i	commandeered	your	i	need	time	for	a	little	see
