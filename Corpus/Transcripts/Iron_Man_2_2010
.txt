always	be	able	to	foresee	thank	you	god	bless	iron	man	god	bless	america	that	is	well	said	mr	hammer	the	committee	would	now	like	to	invite	lieutenant	colonel	james	rhodes	to	the	chamber	rhodey?	what?	hey	buddy	i	didn't	
expect	to	see	you	here	look	it's	me	i'm	here	deal	with	it	let's	move	on	i	just	drop	it	all	right	i'll	drop	it	i	have	before	me	a	complete	report	on	the	iron	man	w*apon	compiled	by	colonel	
rhodes	and	colonel	for	the	record	can	you	please	read	page	57	paragraph	four?	you're	requesting	that	i	read	specific	selections	from	my	report	senator?	yes	sir	it	was	my	understanding	that	i	was	going	to	be	testifying	in	a	
much	more	comprehensive	and	detailed	manner	i	understand	a	lot	of	things	have	changed	today	so	if	you	could	just	read	you	do	understand	that	reading	a	single	paragraph	out	of	context	does	not	reflect	the	summary	of	my	final	
just	read	it	colonel	i	do	thank	you	very	well	"as	he	does	not	operate	within	any	definable	branch	of	government,	"	"iron	man	presents	a	potential	threat	to	the	security	of	both	the	nation"	"and	to	her	interests	"	
i	did	however	go	on	to	summarise	that	the	benefits	of	iron	man	far	outweigh	the	liabilities	and	that	it	would	be	in	our	interest	that's	enough	colonel	to	fold	mr	stark	that's	enough	into	the	existing	chain	of	command	
senator	i'm	not	a	joiner	but	i'll	consider	secretary	of	defense	if	you	ask	nice	we	can	amend	the	hours	a	little	bit	i'd	like	to	go	on	and	show	if	i	may	the	imagery	that's	connected	to	your	report	
i	believe	it	is	somewhat	premature	to	reveal	these	images	to	the	general	public	at	this	time	with	all	due	respect	colonel	i	understand	and	if	you	could	just	narrate	those	for	us	we'd	be	very	grateful	let's	have	the	
images	intelligence	suggests	that	the	devices	seen	in	these	photos	are	in	fact	attempts	at	making	manned	copies	of	mr	stark's	suit	this	has	been	corroborated	by	our	allies	and	local	intelligence	on	the	ground	indicating	that	these	suits	are	
quite	possibly	at	this	moment	operational	hold	on	one	second	buddy	let	me	see	something	here	boy	i'm	good	i	commandeered	your	screens	i	need	them	time	for	a	little	transparency	now	let's	see	what's	really	going	on	what	is
