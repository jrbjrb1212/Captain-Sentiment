they	never	made	it	to	the	airport	or	all	the	things	i	did	to	avoid	processing	my	grief	but	plus	
$611	million	for	my	little	therapeutic	experiment?	no	one	in	their	right	mind	would've	ever	funded	it	help	me	out

self	cooking	hotdog	basically	chemical	detonator	embedded	restroom's	this	way	yeah?	yeah	embedded	in	the	meat	shaft	mr	stark	i	
am	so	sorry	about	the	teleprompter	i	didn't	know	miss	potts	had	cancelled	they	didn't	have	time	to	fix	it

ah	they	deserve	it	plus	it	helps	ease	my	conscience	they	say	there's	a	correlation	between	generosity	and	guilt	but

i	want	to	be	okay	hey	sorry	it's	an	occupational	hazard	i	work	for	the	state	department	human	resources	i	
know	it's	boring	but	it	enabled	me	to	raise	a	son	i'm	very	proud	of	what	he	grew	up	to	
be	his	name	was	charlie	spencer	you	m*rder	him	in	sokovia	not	that	that	matters	in	the	least	to	you	
you	think	you	fight	for	us?	you	just	fight	for	yourself	who's	going	to	avenge	my	son	stark?	he's	dead	
and	i	blame	you	female	news	anchor:	11	wakandans	were	among	those	k*ll	during	a	confrontation	between	the	avengers	and	
a	group	of	mercenaries	in	lagos	nigeria	last	month	the	traditionally	reclusive	wakandans	were	on	an	outreach	mission	in	lagos	
when	the	attack	occurred	our	people's	bl*od	is	spilled	on	foreign	soil	not	only	because	of	the	actions	of	criminals	
but	by	the	indifference	of	those	pledged	to	stop	them	victory	at	the	expense	of	the	innocent	is	no	victory	
at	all	female	news	anchor:	the	wakandan	king	went	on	to	male	pundit:	(on	tv)	they	are	operating	outside	and	
above	the	international	law	because	that's	the	reality	if	we	don't	respond	to	acts	like	these	what	legal	authority	does	
an	enhanced	individual	like	wanda	maximoff	have	to	operate	in	nigeri	?	it's	my	fault	that's	not	true	turn	the	
tv	back	on	they're	being	very	specific	i	should've	clocked	that	b*mb	vest	long	before	you	had	to	deal	with	
it	rumlow	said	"bucky"	and	all	of	a	sudden	i	was	a	16	year	old	kid	again	in	brooklyn	and	
people	died	it's	on	me	it's	on	both	of	us	this	job	we	try	to	save	as	many	people	as	
we	can	sometimes	that	doesn't	mean	everybody	but	if	we	can't	find	a	way	to	live	with	that	then	next	
time	maybe	nobody	gets	saved	vis	we	talked	about	this	yes	but	the	door	was	open	so	i	assumed	that	
captain	rogers	wished	to	know	when	mr	stark	was	arriving	thank	you	we'll	be	right	down	i'll	use	the	door	
oh	and	apparently	he's	brought	a	guest	steve:	we	know	who	it	is?	the	secretary	of	state	secretary	ross:	(sighs)	
five	years	ago	i	had	a	heart	attack	and	dropped	right	in	the	middle	of	my	backswing	turned	out	it	
was	the	best	round	of	my	life	because	after	13	hours	of	surgery	and	a	triple	bypass	i	found	something	
40	years	in	the	army	had	never	taught	me	perspective	the	world	owes	the	avengers	an	unpayable	debt	you	have	
fought	for	us	protected	us	risked	your	lives	but	while	a	great	many	people	see	you	as	heroes	there	are	
some	who	would	prefer	the	word	"vigilantes	"	what	word	would	you	use	mr	secretary?	how	about	"dangerous"?	what	would	
you	call	a	group	of	us	based,	enhanced	individuals	who	routinely	ignore	sovereign	borders	and	inflict	their	will	wherever	they	
choose	and	who	frankly	seem	unconcerned	about	what	they	leave	behind?	new	york	(people	screaming)	washington	d	c	(people	screaming)	
sokovia	lagos	(siren	wailing)	okay	that's	enough	for	the	past	four	years	you've	operated	with	unlimited	power	and	no	supervision	
that's	an	arrangement	the	governments	of	the	world	can	no	longer	tolerate	but	i	think	we	have	a	solution	the	
sokovia	accords	approved	by	117	countries	it	states	that	the	avengers	shall	no	longer	be	a	private	organization	instead	they'll	
operate	under	the	supervision	of	a	united	nations	panel	only	when	and	if	that	panel	deems	it	necessary	the	avengers	
were	formed	to	make	the	world	a	safer	place	i	feel	we've	done	that	tell	me	captain	do	you	know	
where	thor	and	banner	are	right	now?	if	i	misplaced	a	couple	of	30	megaton	nukes	you	can	bet	there'd	
be	consequences	compromise	reassurance	that's	how	the	world	works	believe	me	this	is	the	middle	ground	so	there	are	contingencies	
three	days	from	now	the	un	meets	in	vienna	to	ratify	the	accords	talk	it	over	and	if	we	come	
to	a	decision	you	don't	like?	then	you	retire	(vehicle	crashing)	man:	hello?	is	this	your	car	out	front?	i	
jumped	the	kerb	maybe	we	could	take	care	of	it	ourselves	if	you	wanna	call	the	cops	that's	okay	too	
i	guess	no	no	cops	thank	you	(clatters)	(karpov	straining)	you	have	kept	your	looks	colonel	congratulations	"mission	report	december	
16	1991	"	who	are	you?	my	name	is	zemo	i	will	repeat	my	question	mission	report	december	16	1991	
how	did	you	find	me?	when	s	h	i	e	l	d	fell	black	widow	released	hydra	files	to	the	
public	millions	of	pages	much	of	it	encrypted	not	easy	to	decipher	but	i	have	experience	and	patience	a	man	
can	do	anything	if	he	has	those	what	do	you	want?	mission	report	december	16	1991	go	to	hell	(breathing	
heavily)	hydra	deserves	its	place	on	the	ash	heap	so	your	death	would	not	bother	me	but	i'd	have	to	
use	this	book	and	other	bloodier	methods	to	find	what	i	need	i	don't	look	forward	to	that	you'd	only	
be	dying	for	your	pride	hail	hydra	(choking)	secretary	ross	has	a	congressional	medal	of	honour	which	is	one	more	
than	you	have	sam:	so	let's	say	we	agree	to	this	thing	how	long	is	it	gonna	be	before	they	
lojack	us	like	a	bunch	of	common	criminals?	117	countries	want	to	sign	this	117	sam	and	you're	just	like	
"no	that's	cool	we	got	it	"	how	long	are	you	going	to	play	both	sides?	i	have	an	equation	
oh	this	will	clear	it	up	in	the	eight	years	since	mr	stark	announced	himself	as	iron	man	the	number	
of	known	enhanced	persons	has	grown	exponentially	during	the	same	period	the	number	of	potentially	world	ending	events	has	risen	
at	a	commensurate	rate	are	you	saying	it's	our	fault?	i'm	saying	there	may	be	a	causality	our	very	strength	
invites	challenge	challenge	incites	conflict	and	conflict	breeds	catastrophe	oversight	oversight	is	not	an	idea	that	can	be	dismissed	out	
of	hand	boom	natasha:	tony	you	are	being	uncharacteristically	non	hyperverbal.	it's	because	he's	already	made	up	his	mind	boy	
you	know	me	so	well	actually	i'm	nursing	an	electromagnetic	headache	that's	what's	going	on	cap	it's	just	pain	it's

level	gig	at	intel	planned	for	the	fall	but	first	he	wanted	to	put	a	few	miles	on	his	soul	
before	he	parked	it	behind	a	desk	see	the	world	maybe	be	of	service	charlie	didn't	want	to	go	to	
vegas	or	fort	lauderdale	which	is	what	i	would	do	he	didn't	go	to	paris	or	amsterdam	which	sounds	fun	
he	decided	to	spend	his	summer	building	sustainable	housing	for	the	poor	guess	where	sokovia	he	wanted	to	make	a	
difference	i	suppose	we	won't	know	because	we	dropped	a	building	on	him	while	we	were	kicking	ass	there's	no	
decision	making	process	here	we	need	to	be	put	in	check	whatever	form	that	takes	i'm	game	if	we	can't	
accept	limitations	if	we're	boundary	less...	we're	no	better	than	the	bad	guys	tony	someone	dies	on	your	watch	you	
don't	give	up	who	said	we're	giving	up?	we	are	if	we're	not	taking	responsibility	for	our	actions	this	document	
just	shifts	the	blame	i'm	sorry	steve	that	is	dangerously	arrogant	this	is	the	united	nations	we're	talking	about	it's	
not	the	world	security	council	it's	not	s	h	i	e	l	d	,	it's	not	hydra	no	but	it's	
run	by	people	with	agendas	and	agendas	change	that's	good	that's	why	i'm	here	when	i	realised	what	my	w*apon	
were	capable	of	in	the	wrong	hands	i	shut	it	down	and	stopped	manufacturing	tony	you	chose	to	do	that	
if	we	sign	this	we	surrender	our	right	to	choose	what	if	this	panel	sends	us	somewhere	we	don't	think	
we	should	go?	what	if	there	is	somewhere	we	need	to	go	and	they	don't	let	us?	we	may	not	
be	perfect	but	the	safest	hands	are	still	our	own	if	we	don't	do	this	now	it's	gonna	be	done	
to	us	later	that's	the	fact	that	won't	be	pretty	you're	saying	they'll	come	for	me	we	would	protect	you	
natasha:	maybe	tony's	right	if	we	have	one	hand	on	the	wheel	we	can	still	steer	if	we	take	it	
off	aren't	you	the	same	woman	who	told	the	government	to	kiss	her	ass	a	few	years	ago?	i'm	just	
reading	the	terrain	we	have	made	some	very	public	mistakes	we	need	to	win	their	trust	back	focus	up	i'm

had	a	photograph	in	her	office	aunt	peggy	standing	next	to	jfk	as	a	kid	that	was	pretty	cool	but	
it	was	a	lot	to	live	up	to	which	is	why	i	never	told	anyone	we	were	related	i	asked	
her	once	how	she	managed	to	master	diplomacy	and	espionage	in	a	time	when	no	one	wanted	to	see	a	
woman	succeed	at	either	she	said	compromise	where	you	can	but	where	you	can't	don't	even	if	everyone	is	telling	
you	that	something	wrong	is	something	right	even	if	the	whole	world	is	telling	you	to	move	it	is	your	
duty	to	plant	yourself	like	a	tree	look	them	in	the	eye	and	say	"no	you	move	"	when	i	
came	out	of	the	ice	i	thought	everyone	i	had	known	was	gone	then	i	found	out	she	was	alive
