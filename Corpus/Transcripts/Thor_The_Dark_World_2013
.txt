Thor_The_Dark_World_2013

long	before	the	birth	of	light	there	was	darkness	and	from	that	darkness	came	the	dark	elves	millennia	ago	the	
most	ruthless	of	their	kind	malekith	sought	to	transform	our	universe	back	into	one	of	eternal	night	such	evil	was	
possible	through	the	power	of	the	aether	an	ancient	force	of	infinite	destruction	malekith	asgard's	forces	are	upon	us	the	
noble	armies	of	asgard	led	by	my	father	king	bor	waged	a	mighty	w*r	against	these	creatures	send	in	the	
cursed	as	the	nine	worlds	converged	above	him	malekith	could	at	last	unleash	the	aether	ahh	but	asgard	ripped	the	
w*apon	from	his	grasp	without	it	the	dark	elves	fell	with	the	battle	all	but	lost	malekith	sacrificed	his	own	
people	in	a	desperate	attempt	to	lay	waste	to	asgard's	army	their	deaths	will	mean	our	survival	this	w*r	is	
far	from	over	malekith	was	vanquished	and	the	aether	was	no	more	or	so	we	were	led	to	believe	sire	
the	aether	shall	we	destroy	it?	if	only	we	could	but	its	power	is	too	great	bury	it	deep	somewhere	
no	one	will	ever	find	it	loki	hello	mother	have	i	made	you	proud?	please	don't	make	this	worse	define	
"worse	"	enough	i	will	speak	to	the	prisoner	alone	i	really	don't	see	what	all	the	fuss	is	about	
do	you	not	truly	feel	the	gravity	of	your	crimes?	wherever	you	go	there	is	w*r	ruin	and	death	i	
went	down	to	midgard	to	rule	the	people	of	earth	as	a	benevolent	god	just	like	you	we	are	not	
gods	we	are	born	we	live	we	die	just	as	humans	do	give	or	take	5	000	years	all	this	
because	loki	desires	a	throne	it	is	my	birthright	your	birthright	was	to	die	as	a	child	cast	out	onto	
a	frozen	rock	if	i	had	not	taken	you	in	you	would	not	be	here	now	to	hate	me	if

witless	oaf	king	while	i	rot	in	chains	thor	must	strive	to	undo	the	damage	you	have	done	he	will

scene	shortly	after	11	a	m	this	morning	after	a	seemingly	harmless	rambler	approached	the	area	then	decided	to	strip	
naked	and	effectively	terrorize	tourists	there	with	scientific	equipment	whilst	shouting	that	he	was	trying	to	save	them	the	man	
later	identified	as	noted	astrophysicist	dr	erik	selvig	has	been	called	in	for	questioning	by	police	come	on	this	is	
exciting	look	the	intern	is	excited	"ian	"	do	you	want	the	phase	meter?	no	bring	the	phase	meter	the	
toaster	looking	thing	yeah	i	know	what	the	phase	meter	is	how	do	i	change	the	ring	tone	on	this	
thing?	an	astrophysicist	with	three	degrees	should	be	able	to	change	her	own	ring	tone.	why	are	you	calling	me?	
i	didn't	want	to	shout	intern	says	it's	this	way	"ian	"	my	name	is	ian	shh	i	am	not

can	sense	it	even	fewer	can	see	it	but	while	its	effects	can	be	dangerous	it	is	truly	beautiful	i

not	of	earth	what	is	it?	we	do	not	know	but	she	will	not	survive	the	amount	of	energy	surging	
within	her	that's	a	quantum	field	generator	isn't	it?	it's	a	soul	forge	does	a	soul	forge	transfer	molecular	energy	
from	one	place	to	another?	yes	quantum	field	generator	my	words	are	mere	noises	to	you	that	you	ignore	them	
completely?	she	is	ill	she	is	mortal	illness	is	their	defining	trait	i	brought	her	here	because	we	can	help

just	who	do	you	think	you	are?	i	am	odin	king	of	asgard	protector	of	the	nine	realms	oh	well	
i'm	i	know	very	well	who	you	are	jane	foster	you	told	your	dad	about	me?	something	is	within	her	
father	something	i	have	not	seen	before	her	world	has	its	healers	they	are	called	"doctors	"	let	them	deal	
with	it	guards	take	her	back	to	midgard	no	i	would	not	touch	her	jane	are	you	all	right?	yeah	
it's	impossible	the	infection	it's	defending	her	no	it's	defending	itself	come	with	me	there	are	relics	that	pre	date	
the	universe	itself	what	lies	within	her	appears	to	be	one	of	them	the	nine	realms	are	not	eternal	they	
had	a	dawn	as	they	will	have	a	dusk	but	before	that	dawn	the	dark	forces	the	dark	elves	reigned	
absolute	and	unchallenged	born	of	eternal	night	"the	dark	elves	come	to	steal	away	the	light	"	i	know	these	
stories	mother	told	them	to	us	as	children	their	leader	malekith	made	a	w*apon	out	of	that	darkness	and	it	
was	called	the	aether	while	the	other	relics	often	appear	as	stones	the	aether	is	fluid	and	ever	changing	it	
changes	matter	into	dark	matter	it	seeks	out	host	bodies	drawing	strength	from	their	life	force.	malekith	sought	to	use	
the	aether's	power	to	return	the	universe	to	one	of	darkness	but	after	eternities	of	bloodshed	my	father	bor	finally	
triumphed	ushering	in	a	peace	that	lasted	thousands	of	years	what	happened?	he	k*ll	them	all	are	you	certain?	the	
aether	was	said	to	have	been	destroyed	with	them	and	yet	here	it	is	the	dark	elves	are	dead	does	
your	book	happen	to	mention	how	to	get	it	out	of	me?	no	it	does	not	the	worlds	are	nearly	
aligned	you	will	be	the	last	of	the	kursed	let	my	life	be	sacrificed	it	is	no	less	than	our	
people	did	or	you	have	done	you	will	become	darkness	cursed	to	this	existence	until	it	consumes	you	until	then	
no	power	our	enemies	possess	can	stop	you	i	will	tear	down	their	defenses	and	ensure	your	return	to	a	
universe	reborn	acting	as	caretakers	to	these	scoundrels	is	beneath	us	oh	please	if	they	were	beneath	you	my	rotund	
friend	they'd	all	be	dead	keep	in	line	move	it	odin	continues	to	bring	me	new	friends	how	thoughtful	the	
books	i	sent	do	they	not	interest	you?	is	that	how	i	am	to	while	away	eternity?	reading?	i've	done	
everything	in	my	power	to	make	you	comfortable	loki	have	you?	does	odin	share	your	concern?	does	thor?	it	must	
be	so	inconvenient	them	asking	after	me	day	and	night	you	know	full	well	it	was	your	actions	that	brought	
you	here	my	actions?	i	was	merely	giving	truth	to	the	lie	that	i	had	been	fed	my	entire	life	
that	i	was	born	to	be	a	king	a	king?	a	true	king	admits	his	faults	what	of	the	lives	
you	took	on	earth?	a	mere	handful	compared	to	the	number	that	odin	has	taken	himself	your	father	he's	not	
my	father	then	am	i	not	your	mother?	you're	not	you're	always	so	perceptive	about	everyone	but	yourself	when	you	
came	for	me	you	knew	i	was	in	trouble	heimdall	had	lost	sight	of	you	you	were	no	longer	on	
earth	how	is	that	possible?	i	believe	you	were	and	you	weren't	the	nine	realms	travel	within	yggdrasil	orbiting	midgard	
much	the	way	your	planets	orbit	the	sun	and	every	5	000	years	the	worlds	align	perfectly	and	we	call	
this	the	convergence	during	this	time	the	borders	between	worlds	become	blurred	it's	possible	you	found	one	of	these	points	
we	are	lucky	that	it	remained	open	once	the	worlds	pass	out	of	alignment	then	the	connection	is	lost	i	
like	the	way	you	explain	things	what's	going	to	happen	to	me?	i'll	find	a	way	to	save	you	jane	
your	father	said	there	was	my	father	doesn't	know	everything	don't	let	him	hear	you	say	that	jane	foster	please	
meet	frigga	queen	of	asgard	and	my	mother	hi	move	to	the	dungeons	come	on	you	might	want	to	take	
the	stairs	to	the	left	the	prisons	loki	go	i	will	look	after	her	it's	as	if	they	resent	being	
imprisoned	there's	no	pleasing	some	creatures	return	to	your	cells	no	further	harm	will	come	to	you	you	have	my	
word	very	well	you	do	not	have	my	word	send	a	squadron	to	the	w*apon	vault	defend	it	at	all	
costs	secure	the	dungeon	odin	frigga	go	it's	a	skirmish	nothing	to	fear	you've	never	been	a	very	good	liar	
take	her	to	your	chambers	i'll	come	for	you	when	it's	safe	you	take	care	despite	all	i	have	survived	
my	queen	still	worries	over	me	it's	only	because	i	worry	over	you	that	you	have	survived	listen	to	me	
now	i	need	you	to	do	everything	i	ask	no	questions	yes	ma'am	oh	ow	ah	the	throne	of	asgard	
is	destroyed	to	the	king	frigga	stand	down	creature	and	you	may	still	survive	this	i	have	survived	worse	woman	
who	are	you?	i	am	malekith	and	i	would	have	what	is	mine	ah	you	have	taken	something	child	give	
it	back	witch	where	is	the	aether?	i'll	never	tell	you	i	believe	you	no	the	universe	rotates	on	a	
5	000	year	cycle	and	once	a	cycle	all	the	worlds	align	imagine	imagine	that	this	is	our	world	oh	
thank	you	and	this	is	another	world	normally	they're	separate	but	during	the	alignment	everything	is	connected	all	nine	realms	
all	nine	realms	are	passing	through	each	other	and	gravity	light	and	even	matter	is	crashing	from	one	world	to	
the	other	but	if	this	happens	to	us	now	the	result	will	be	cataclysmic	my	gravimetric	spikes	can	stabilize	the	
focal	point	of	the	convergence	this	time	the	alignment	and	all	the	other	worlds	would	just	pass	us	by	it's	
beautiful	it's	simple	any	questions?	yeah	can	i	have	my	shoe	back?	heal	you	will	need	your	strength	to	reclaim	
the	aether	and	when	you	wake	we	will	k*ll	them	all	jane	foster?	you	need	to	come	with	us	we	
are	still	unable	to	restore	the	palace	shields	our	a*tillery	cannot	detect	them	even	heimdall	cannot	see	them	my	king	
we	are	all	but	defenseless	she's	your	prisoner	now?	leave	us	i	do	not	wish	to	fight	with	you	nor	
i	with	you	but	i	intend	to	pursue	malekith	we	possess	the	aether	malekith	will	come	to	us	yes	and	
he	will	destroy	us	you	overestimate	the	power	of	these	creatures	no	i	value	our	people's	lives	i'll	take	jane	
to	the	dark	world	and	draw	the	enemy	away	from	asgard	when	malekith	pulls	the	aether	from	jane	it	will	
be	exposed	and	vulnerable	and	i	will	destroy	it	and	him	if	you	fail	you	risk	this	w*apon	falling	into	
the	hands	of	our	enemies	the	risk	is	far	greater	if	we	do	nothing	his	ship	could	be	over	our	
heads	right	now	we	would	never	even	know	it	if	and	when	he	comes	his	men	will	fall	on	10	
000	asgardian	blades	and	how	many	of	our	men	shall	fall	on	theirs?	as	many	as	are	needed	ah	we	
will	fight	till	the	last	asgardian	breath	till	the	last	drop	of	asgardian	bl*od	then	how	are	you	different	from	
malekith?	the	difference	my	son	is	that	i	will	win	jane	isn't	calling	me	back	erik	isn't	calling	me	back

supposed	to	do	something	else	went	missing	this	week	when	astrophysicist	dr	erik	selvig	notable	for	his	involvement	in	the	
alien	invasion	of	new	york	streaked	nude	across	darcy	you	really	need	to	look	at	this	your	friend	erik	what	
was	his	last	name	again?	and	began	shouting	at	visitors	to	the	historic	site	he	was	later	taken	into	police	
custody	for	psychiatric	evaluation	police	are	still	refusing	to	confirm	you	were	not	at	odin's	w*r	council	the	bifrost	is

allfather	strong	and	unchallenged	whether	he	is	or	not	but	he	is	blinded	heimdall	by	hatred	and	by	grief	as	
are	we	all	i	see	clearly	enough	the	risks	are	too	great	everything	we	do	from	here	on	is	a	
risk	there	is	no	other	way	what	do	you	require	of	me?	what	i'm	about	to	ask	of	you	is	
treason	of	the	highest	order	success	will	bring	us	exile	and	failure	shall	mean	our	death	malekith	knew	the	aether	
was	here	he	can	sense	its	power	if	we	do	nothing	he	will	come	for	it	again	but	this	time	
lay	waste	to	all	of	asgard	we	must	move	jane	off	world.	the	bifrost	has	been	shut	down	and	the	
tesseract	locked	away	in	the	vault	there	are	other	paths	off	asgard	ways	known	only	to	a	few	one	actually	
no	thor	after	all	this	time	and	now	you	come	to	visit	me	why?	have	you	come	to	gloat?	to	
mock?	loki	enough	no	more	illusions	now	you	see	me	brother	did	she	suffer?	i	did	not	come	here	to	
share	our	grief	instead	i	offer	you	the	chance	of	a	far	richer	sacrament	go	on	i	know	you	seek	
vengeance	as	much	as	i	do	you	help	me	escape	asgard	and	i	will	grant	it	to	you	vengeance	and	
afterward	this	cell	you	must	be	truly	desperate	to	come	to	me	for	help	what	makes	you	think	you	can	
trust	me?	i	don't	mother	did	but	you	should	know	that	when	we	fought	each	other	in	the	past	i	
did	so	with	a	glimmer	of	hope	that	my	brother	was	still	in	there	somewhere	that	hope	no	longer	exists	
to	protect	you	you	betray	me	and	i	will	k*ll	you	hmm	when	do	we	start?	he	will	betray	you

where	all	the	nine	worlds	are	connecting	amplifying	the	w*apon's	impact	for	each	additional	world	the	power	will	increase	exponentially	
the	effect	would	be	universal	but	the	alignment	is	only	temporary	he	must	be	in	exactly	the	right	place	at	
the	right	time	well	how	do	we	know	where	that	is?	we	follow	the	directions	this	has	happened	before	thousands	
of	years	ago	and	the	ancients	were	there	to	see	it	all	the	great	constructions	the	mayans	the	chinese	the	
egyptians	they	made	use	of	the	gravitational	effects	of	the	convergence	and	they	left	us	a	map	stonehenge	snow	don,	
the	great	orme	these	are	all	coordinates	taking	us	here	greenwich?	the	walls	between	worlds	will	be	almost	non	existent.	
physics	is	going	to	go	ballistic	increases	and	decreases	in	gravity	spatial	extrusions	the	very	fabric	of	reality	is	going	
to	be	torn	apart	i	better	get	my	pants	focus	this	is	important	we	have	to	hammer	them	in	all	
around	the	site	and	then	jane	and	erik	will	activate	them	from	the	tower	they're	taped	together	do	you	even

come	on	come	on	darcy	you	know	with	all	that	power	i	thought	you'd	hit	harder	done	the	convergence	will	
be	in	full	effect	in	seven	minutes	that	just	means	we	have	to	keep	malekith	busy	for	eight	okay	you	
might	want	to	hold	on	to	something	that	is	awesome	how	did	you	do	that?	well	the	gravitational	fields	interact

would	never	be	a	wiser	king	than	me	you	were	wrong	the	alignment	has	brought	all	the	realms	together	every	
one	of	them	saw	you	offer	your	life	to	save	them	what	can	asgard	offer	its	new	king	in	return?	
my	life	father	i	cannot	be	king	of	asgard	i	will	protect	asgard	and	all	the	realms	with	my	last

me	to	see	her	or	say	she	can	rule	at	my	side	it	changes	nothing	one	son	who	wanted	the	
throne	too	much	another	who	will	not	take	it	is	this	my	legacy?	loki	died	with	honor	i	shall	try	
to	live	the	same	is	that	not	legacy	enough?	it	belongs	to	you	if	you	are	worthy	of	it	i	
shall	try	to	be	i	cannot	give	you	my	blessing	nor	can	i	wish	you	good	fortune	i	know	if	
i	were	proud	of	the	man	my	son	had	become	even	that	i	could	not	say	it	would	speak	only	
from	my	heart	go	my	son	thank	you	father	no	thank	you	i	present	to	you	taneleer	tivan	the	collector	
whoa	asgardians	it's	an	honor	you	know	why	we're	here	of	course	but	if	i	may	ask	why	not	keep	
it	secure	in	your	own	vault?	the	tesseract	is	already	on	asgard	it	is	not	wise	to	keep	two	infinity	
stones	so	close	together	that's	very	wise	i	can	assure	you	it	will	be	absolutely	safe	here	in	my	collection	
see	that	it	is	one	down
