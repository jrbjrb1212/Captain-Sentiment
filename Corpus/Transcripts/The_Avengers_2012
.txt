we	control	the	there	may	not	be	a	minimum	safe	i	need	you	to	make	sure	the	phase	prototypes	are	
shipped	is	that	really	a	priority	right	until	such	time	as	the	world	we	will	act	as	though	it	intends	
to	spin	clear	out	the	tech	every	piece	of	phase	on	a	truck	and	with	talk	to	is	there	anything	
we	know	for	the	tesseract	is	is	that	supposed	to	be	not	funny	at	the	tesseract	is	not	only	i	
assume	you	pulled	the	an	energy	we	turn	off	the	she	turns	it	back	if	she	reaches	peak	we	prepared	
for	harnessing	energy	from	but	we	have	the	my	calculations	are	far	from	and	throwing	off	nothing	low	levels	of

he	needs	you	on	he	needs	me	in	a	no	going	to	put	you	in	stop	lying	to	that	was	
i	just	wanted	to	see	what	why	we	do	this	the	easy	way	where	you	use	that	and	the	other	
guy	make	a	stand	good	you	and	this	is	out	of	dealing	with	forces	you	you	ever	been	in	a	
in	a	did	you	feel	an	overabundance	of	saying	that	this	asgard	is	declaring	on	our	not	he	be	working	
what	about	the	other	his	our	intelligence	says	thor	is	not	a	hostile	but	worlds	we	depend	on	him	to	
up	to	which	is	why	you	should	be	focusing	on	phase	it	was	designed	for	exactly	phase	our	enemy	we	
need	a	response	the	avengers	initiative	was	shut	this	about	the	seen	the	running	the	greatest	covert	security	network	and	
going	to	leave	the	fate	of	the	human	race	to	a	handful	of	not	leaving	anything	to	we	need	a

him	under	some	kind	of	along	with	one	of	i	want	to	know	why	loki	let	us	take	not	leading	
an	army	from	i	think	we	should	be	focusing	on	that	brain	is	a	bag	full	of	you	could	smell	
crazy	on	have	care	how	you	loki	is	beyond	but	he	is	of	and	he	is	my	he	people	in	
two	i	think	about	the	what	do	they	need	the	iridium	a	stabilising	just	pick	a	fly	you	to	keep	
love	it	means	the	portal	collapse	on	itself	like	it	did	at	no	hard	point	got	a	mean	it	means	
the	portal	can	open	as	wide	and	stay	open	as	as	loki	raise	the	jib	the	that	man	is	playing	
he	thought	we	but	we	how	does	fury	even	see	he	sounds	the	rest	of	the	raw	agent	barton	can	
get	his	hands	on	pretty	the	only	major	component	he	still	needs	is	a	power	source	of	something	to	the	
when	did	you	become	an	expert	in	thermonuclear	last	the	the	extraction	theory	am	i	the	only	one	who	did	
the	does	loki	need	any	particular	kind	of	power	he	would	have	to	heat	the	cube	to	kelvin	just	to	
break	through	the	coulomb	unless	selvig	has	figured	out	how	to	stabilise	the	quantum	tunnelling	if	he	could	do	he	
could	achieve	heavy	ion	fusion	at	any	reactor	on	the	someone	who	speaks	is	that	what	just	good	to	meet	
dr	your	work	on	antielectron	collisions	is	and	a	huge	fan	of	the	way	you	lose	control	and	turn	into	
an	enormous	green	dr	banner	is	only	here	to	track	the	i	was	hoping	you	might	join	i	would	start	
with	that	stick	of	it	may	be	but	it	works	an	awful	lot	like	a	hydra	i	know	about	but	
it	is	powered	by	the	and	i	would	like	to	know	how	loki	used	it	to	turn	two	of	the	
sharpest	men	i	know	into	his	personal	flying	i	do	not	i	i	understood	that	shall	we	this	the	gamma	
readings	are	definitely	consistent	with	reports	of	the	but	going	to	take	weeks	to	if	we	bypass	their	mainframe	and	
direct	route	to	the	homer	we	can	clock	this	at	around	all	i	packed	was	a	you	you	should	come	
by	stark	tower	top	ten	all	love	candy	but	the	last	time	i	was	in	new	i	kind	of	broke	
i	promise	a	no	no	are	you	you	really	have	got	a	lid	on	your	mellow	bongo	huge	bag	of	
is	everything	a	joke	to	funny	things	threatening	the	safety	of	everyone	on	this	ship	no	all	i	have	come	
aboard	if	i	handle	pointy	big	you	need	to	and	you	need	to	focus	on	the	mr	do	you	think	
why	did	fury	call	us	why	why	not	what	he	telling	i	do	the	equation	unless	i	have	all	the	
you	think	hiding	a	his	secrets	have	bugging	i	just	want	to	finish	my	work	warm	light	for	all	jab	
at	fury	about	the	i	heard	i	think	that	was	meant	for	even	if	barton	tell	loki	about	the	it	
was	still	all	over	the	the	stark	that	ugly	building	in	new	powered	by	an	arc	a	energy	that	building	
will	run	itself	a	just	the	kind	of	the	only	name	in	clean	energy	right	what	getting	why	bring	him	
in	on	the	tesseract	what	are	they	doing	in	the	energy	business	in	the	first	i	should	probably	look	into	
that	once	my	decryption	programme	finishes	breaking	into	all	of	secure	did	you	jarvis	has	been	running	it	since	i	
hit	the	in	a	few	know	every	dirty	secret	has	ever	tried	to	yet	confused	about	why	they	want	you	
an	intelligence	organisation	that	fears	not	i	think	trying	to	wind	us	this	is	a	man	who	means	to	start	
a	and	if	we	stay	we	have	we	should	follow	not	really	my	and	all	about	of	the	people	in	
this	which	one	wearing	a	spangly	not	of	tell	me	none	of	this	smells	a	little	funky	to	just	find	
the	the	guy	my	dad	never	shut	up	wondering	if	they	have	kept	him	on	the	not	wrong	about	he	
does	have	the	jump	on	what	got	is	an	acme	dynamite	going	to	blow	up	in	his	and	going	to	
be	there	when	it	read	all	about	or	be	suiting	up	with	the	rest	of	you	i	get	a	suit	
of	like	a	a	got	a	cluster	of	shrapnel	trying	every	second	to	crawl	its	way	into	my	this	stops	
this	little	circle	of	part	of	me	not	just	a	terrible	but	you	can	control	because	i	learned	i	read	
all	about	your	that	much	gamma	exposure	should	have	so	saying	that	the	the	other	guy	saved	my	a	nice	
saved	it	for	i	guess	find	you	may	not	enjoy	and	you	just	as	soon	as	loki	took	the	we	
moved	jane	got	an	excellent	observatory	in	she	was	asked	to	consult	there	very	suddenly	handsome	private	very	be	thank	
no	loki	taking	erik	i	dread	what	he	plans	for	him	once	erik	is	a	good	he	talks	about	you

in	their	when	i	first	came	to	rage	followed	me	and	your	people	paid	the	and	in	my	i	courted	
started	you	think	you	could	make	loki	tell	us	where	the	tesseract	i	do	not	mind	is	far	not	just	
power	he	upon	no	pain	would	prise	his	need	from	a	lot	of	guys	think	that	until	the	pain	what	
are	you	asking	me	to	what	are	you	prepared	to	loki	is	a	then	why	do	i	feel	like	the

after	whatever	tortures	fury	can	you	would	appear	as	a	as	a	and	i	would	i	want	to	know	what	
done	to	agent	i	would	say	expanded	his	and	once	once	king	of	the	what	happens	to	his	is	this	
agent	love	is	for	i	owe	him	a	tell	before	i	worked	for	i	made	a	name	for	i	have	
a	very	specific	i	care	who	i	used	it	or	i	got	on	radar	in	a	bad	agent	barton	was	
sent	to	he	made	a	different	and	what	will	you	do	if	i	vow	to	spare	not	let	you	but

you	wipe	out	that	much	the	hospital	barton	told	me	your	ledger	is	gushing	red	and	you	think	saving	a	
man	no	more	virtuous	than	yourself	will	change	this	is	the	basest	this	is	a	child	at	you	lie	and	
in	the	service	of	liars	and	you	pretend	to	be	to	have	your	own	something	that	makes	up	for	the	
but	they	are	part	of	and	they	will	never	go	i	touch	not	until	i	make	him	in	every	way	
he	knows	you	and	then	wake	just	long	enough	to	see	his	good	work	and	when	he	split	his	this	
is	my	you	mewling	a	you	brought	the	your	loki	means	to	unleash	the	keep	banner	in	the	on	my	
send	thor	as	thank	you	for	your	what	are	you	mr	kind	of	been	wondering	the	same	thing	about	supposed	
to	be	locating	the	we	the	locked	and	sweeping	for	the	signature	when	we	get	a	have	the	location	within	
half	a	then	you	get	your	cube	no	no	what	is	phase	is	uses	the	cube	to	make	computer	was	
moving	a	little	slow	for	we	gathered	everything	related	to	the	this	does	not	mean	that	what	were	you	i	
was	the	world	changed	a	did	you	know	about	you	want	to	think	about	removing	yourself	from	this	i	was	
in	i	was	pretty	well	loki	is	manipulating	and	been	doing	you	come	here	because	i	bat	my	eyelashes	at	
and	not	leaving	because	suddenly	you	get	a	little	like	to	know	why	is	using	the	tesseract	to	build	of	
mass	because	of	last	earth	had	a	visitor	from	another	planet	who	had	a	grudge	match	that	levelled	a	small	
we	learned	that	not	only	are	we	not	alone	but	we	are	my	people	want	nothing	but	peace	with	your	
but	not	the	only	people	out	are	and	not	the	only	the	filling	up	with	people	who	be	that	be	
like	you	controlled	the	your	work	with	the	tesseract	is	what	drew	loki	to	and	his	it	is	a	signal	
to	all	the	realms	that	the	earth	is	ready	for	a	higher	form	of	a	higher	you	forced	our	we	
had	to	come	up	with	a	nuclear	because	that	always	calms	everything	right	remind	me	again	how	you	made	your	
sure	if	he	still	made	stark	would	be	hold	how	is	this	now	about	i	thought	humans	were	more	evolved	
than	excuse	did	we	come	to	your	planet	and	blow	stuff	you	treat	your	champions	with	such	are	you	boys	
really	that	monitors	potential	captain	on	threat	we	all	on	that	are	you	above	or	below	angry	so	help	me
