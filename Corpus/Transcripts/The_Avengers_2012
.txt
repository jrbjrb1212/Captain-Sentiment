was	and	should	be	king	so	you	take	the	world	i	love	as	a	recompense	for	your	imagined	slights?	no	
the	earth	is	under	my	protection	loki	and	you're	doing	a	marvellous	job	with	that	the	humans	slaughter	each	other	
in	droves	while	you	idly	fret	i	mean	to	rule	them	as	why	should	i	not?	you	think	yourself	above	
them?	well	yes	then	you	miss	the	truth	of	ruling	brother	a	throne	would	suit	you	ill	i've	seen	worlds	
you've	never	known	about	i	have	grown	odinson	in	my	exile	i	have	seen	the	true	power	of	the	tesseract	
and	when	i	wield	it	who	showed	you	this	power?	who	controls	the	would	be	king?	i	am	a	king	
not	here	you	give	up	the	tesseract	you	give	up	this	poisonous	dream	you	come	home	i	don't	have	it	
you	need	the	cube	to	bring	me	home	but	i've	sent	it	off	i	know	not	where	you	listen	well	
brother	i'm	listening	do	not	touch	me	again	then	don't	take	my	stuff	you	have	no	idea	what	you're	dealing	
with	shakespeare	in	the	park?	doth	mother	know	you	wear	eth	her	drapes?	this	is	beyond	you	metal	man	loki	
will	face	asgardian	justice	he	gives	up	the	cube	he's	all	yours	until	then	stay	out	of	the	way	tourist	
okay	power	at	400%	capacity	how	about	that?	hey	that's	enough	now	i	don't	know	what	you	plan	on	doing	
here	i've	come	here	to	put	an	end	to	loki's	schemes	then	prove	it	put	that	hammer	down	yeah	no	
bad	call	he	loves	his	hammer	you	want	me	to	put	the	hammer	down?	are	we	done	here?	in	case	
it's	unclear	if	you	try	to	escape	if	you	so	much	as	scratch	that	glass	it's	30	000	feet	straight	
down	in	a	steel	trap	you	get	how	that	works?	ant	boot	it's	an	impressive	cage	not	built	i	think	
for	me	built	for	something	a	lot	stronger	than	you	oh	i've	heard	a	mindless	beast	makes	play	he's	still	
a	man	how	desperate	are	you	that	you	call	on	such	lost	creatures	to	defend	you?	how	desperate	am	i?	
you	threaten	my	world	with	w*r	you	steal	a	force	you	can't	hope	to	control	you	talk	about	peace	and	
you	k*ll	because	it's	fun	you	have	made	me	very	desperate	you	might	not	be	glad	that	you	did	it	
burns	you	to	have	come	so	close	to	have	the	tesseract	to	have	power	unlimited	power	and	for	what?	a	
warm	light	for	all	mankind	to	share	and	then	to	be	reminded	what	real	power	is	well	let	me	know	
if	"real	power"	wants	a	magazine	or	something	he	really	grows	on	you	doesn't	he?	loki's	gonna	drag	this	out	
so	thor	what's	his	play?	he	has	an	army	called	the	chitauri	they're	not	of	asgard	nor	any	world	known	
he	means	to	lead	them	against	your	people	they	will	win	him	the	earth	in	return	i	suspect	for	the	
tesseract	an	army	from	outer	space	so	he's	building	another	portal	that's	what	he	needs	erik	selvig	for	selvig?	he's	
an	astrophysicist	he's	a	friend	loki	has	him	under	some	kind	of	spell	along	with	one	of	ours	i	want	
to	know	why	loki	let	us	take	him	he's	not	leading	an	army	from	here	i	don't	think	we	should	
be	focusing	on	loki	that	guy's	brain	is	a	bag	full	of	cats	you	could	smell	crazy	on	him	have	
care	how	you	speak	loki	is	beyond	reason	but	he	is	of	asgard	and	he	is	my	brother	he	k*ll	
80	people	in	two	days	he's	adopted	i	think	it's	about	the	mechanics	iridium	what	do	they	need	the	iridium	
for?	it's	a	stabilising	agent	i'm	just	saying	pick	a	weekend	i'll	fly	you	to	portland	keep	love	alive	it	
means	the	portal	won't	collapse	on	itself	like	it	did	at	s	h	i	e	l	d	no	hard	feelings	
point	break	you've	got	a	mean	swing	also	it	means	the	portal	can	open	as	wide	and	stay	open	as	
long	as	loki	wants	raise	the	mizzenmast	jib	the	topsails	that	man	is	playing	galaga	he	thought	we	wouldn't	notice	
but	we	did	how	does	fury	even	see	these?	he	turns	sounds	exhausting	the	rest	of	the	raw	materials	agent	
barton	can	get	his	hands	on	pretty	easily	the	only	major	component	he	still	needs	is	a	power	source	of	
high	energy	density	something	to	kick	start	the	cube	when	did	you	become	an	expert	in	thermonuclear	astrophysics?	last	night	
the	packet	selvig's	notes	the	extraction	theory	papers	am	i	the	only	one	who	did	the	reading?	does	loki	need	
any	particular	kind	of	power	source?	he	would	have	to	heat	the	cube	to	120	million	kelvin	just	to	break	
through	the	coulomb	barrier	unless	selvig	has	figured	out	how	to	stabilise	the	quantum	tunnelling	effect	well	if	he	could	
do	that	he	could	achieve	heavy	ion	fusion	at	any	reactor	on	the	planet	finally	someone	who	speaks	english	is	
that	what	just	happened?	it's	good	to	meet	you	dr	banner	your	work	on	antielectron	collisions	is	unparalleled	and	i'm	
a	huge	fan	of	the	way	you	lose	control	and	turn	into	an	enormous	green	rage	monster.	thanks	dr	banner	
is	only	here	to	track	the	cube	i	was	hoping	you	might	join	him	i	would	start	with	that	stick	
of	his	it	may	be	magical	but	it	works	an	awful	lot	like	a	hydra	w*apon	i	don't	know	about	
that	but	it	is	powered	by	the	cube	and	i	would	like	to	know	how	loki	used	it	to	turn	
two	of	the	sharpest	men	i	know	into	his	personal	flying	monkeys	monkeys?	i	do	not	understand	i	do	i	
understood	that	reference	shall	we	play	doctor?	this	way	sir	the	gamma	readings	are	definitely	consistent	with	selvig's	reports	of	
the	tesseract	but	it's	going	to	take	weeks	to	process	if	we	bypass	their	mainframe	and	direct	route	to	the	
homer	cluster	we	can	clock	this	at	around	600	teraflops	all	i	packed	was	a	toothbrush	you	know	you	should	
come	by	stark	tower	sometime	top	ten	floors	all	r&amp;d	you'd	love	it	it's	candy	land	thanks	but	the	last	
time	i	was	in	new	york	i	kind	of	broke	harlem	well	i	promise	a	stress	free	environment	no	tension	
no	surprises	hey	nothing?	are	you	nuts?	jury's	out	you	really	have	got	a	lid	on	it	haven't	you?	what's	
your	secret?	mellow	jazz	bongo	drums	huge	bag	of	weed?	is	everything	a	joke	to	you?	funny	things	are	threatening	
the	safety	of	everyone	on	this	ship	isn't	funny	no	offence	doc	it's	all	right	i	wouldn't	have	come	aboard	
if	i	couldn't	handle	pointy	things	you're	tip	toeing,	big	man	you	need	to	strut	and	you	need	to	focus	
on	the	problem	mr	stark	do	you	think	i'm	not?	why	did	fury	call	us	in?	why	now?	why	not	
before?	what	isn't	he	telling	us?	i	can't	do	the	equation	unless	i	have	all	the	variables	you	think	fury's	
hiding	something?	he's	a	spy	captain	he's	"the"	spy	his	secrets	have	secrets	it's	bugging	him	too	isn't	it?	i	
just	want	to	finish	my	work	here	and	doctor?	"a	warm	light	for	all	mankind	"	loki's	jab	at	fury	
about	the	cube	i	heard	it	i	think	that	was	meant	for	you	even	if	barton	didn't	tell	loki	about	
the	tower	it	was	still	all	over	the	news	the	stark	tower?	that	big	ugly	building	in	new	york?	it's	
powered	by	an	arc	reactor	a	self	sustaining	energy	source	that	building	will	run	itself	for	what	a	year?	it's	
just	the	prototype	i'm	kind	of	the	only	name	in	clean	energy	right	now	that's	what	he's	getting	at	so	
why	didn't	s	h	i	e	l	d	bring	him	in	on	the	tesseract	project?	what	are	they	doing	in	
the	energy	business	in	the	first	place?	i	should	probably	look	into	that	once	my	decryption	programme	finishes	breaking	into	
all	of	s	h	i	e	l	d	's	secure	files	i'm	sorry	did	you	say	jarvis	has	been	running	
it	since	i	hit	the	bridge	in	a	few	hours	i'll	know	every	dirty	secret	s	h	i	e	l	
d	has	ever	tried	to	hide	blueberry?	yet	you're	confused	about	why	they	didn't	want	you	around	an	intelligence	organisation	
that	fears	intelligence?	historically	not	awesome	i	think	loki's	trying	to	wind	us	up	this	is	a	man	who	means	
to	start	a	w*r	and	if	we	don't	stay	focused	he'll	succeed	we	have	orders	we	should	follow	them	following's	
not	really	my	style	and	you're	all	about	style	aren't	you?	of	the	people	in	this	room	which	one	is	
a	wearing	a	spangly	outfit	and	b	not	of	use?	steve	tell	me	none	of	this	smells	a	little	funky	
to	you	just	find	the	cube	that's	the	guy	my	dad	never	shut	up	about?	i'm	wondering	if	they	shouldn't	
have	kept	him	on	ice	the	guy's	not	wrong	about	loki	he	does	have	the	jump	on	us	what	he's	
got	is	an	acme	dynamite	kit	it's	going	to	blow	up	in	his	face	and	i'm	going	to	be	there	
when	it	does	yeah	i'll	read	all	about	it	or	you'll	be	suiting	up	with	the	rest	of	us	you	
see	i	don't	get	a	suit	of	armour	i'm	exposed	like	a	nerve	it's	a	nightmare	i've	got	a	cluster	
of	shrapnel	trying	every	second	to	crawl	its	way	into	my	heart	this	stops	it	this	little	circle	of	light	
it's	part	of	me	now	not	just	armour	it's	a	terrible	privilege	but	you	can	control	it	because	i	learned	
how	it's	different	hey	i	read	all	about	your	accident	that	much	gamma	exposure	should	have	k*ll	you	so	you're	
saying	that	the	hulk	the	other	guy	saved	my	life?	that's	nice	it's	a	nice	sentiment	saved	it	for	what?	
i	guess	we'll	find	out	you	may	not	enjoy	that	and	you	just	might	as	soon	as	loki	took	the	
doctor	we	moved	jane	foster	they've	got	an	excellent	observatory	in	troms�	she	was	asked	to	consult	there	very	suddenly	
yesterday	handsome	fee	private	plane	very	remote	she'll	be	safe	thank	you	it's	no	accident	loki	taking	erik	selvig	i	
dread	what	he	plans	for	him	once	he's	done	erik	is	a	good	man	he	talks	about	you	a	lot	
you	changed	his	life	you	changed	everything	around	here	they	were	better	as	they	were	we	pretend	on	asgard	that	
we're	more	advanced	but	we	come	here	battling	like	bilge	snipe	like	what?	bilge	snipe	you	know	huge	scaly	big	
antlers	you	don't	have	those?	i	don't	think	so	well	they	are	repulsive	and	they	trample	everything	in	their	path	
when	i	first	came	to	earth	loki's	rage	followed	me	here	and	your	people	paid	the	price	and	now	again	
in	my	youth	i	courted	w*r	w*r	hasn't	started	yet	you	think	you	could	make	loki	tell	us	where	the	
tesseract	is?	i	do	not	know	loki's	mind	is	far	afield	it's	not	just	power	he	craves	it's	vengeance	upon	
me	there's	no	pain	would	prise	his	need	from	him	a	lot	of	guys	think	that	until	the	pain	starts	
what	are	you	asking	me	to	do?	i'm	asking	what	are	you	prepared	to	do?	loki	is	a	prisoner	then	
why	do	i	feel	like	he's	the	only	person	on	this	boat	that	wants	to	be	here?	there's	not	many	
people	who	can	sneak	up	on	me	but	you	figured	i'd	come	after	after	whatever	tortures	fury	can	concoct	you	
would	appear	as	a	friend	as	a	balm	and	i	would	cooperate	i	want	to	know	what	you've	done	to	
agent	barton	i	would	say	i've	expanded	his	mind	and	once	you've	won	once	you're	king	of	the	mountain	what	
happens	to	his	mind?	is	this	love	agent	romanoff?	love	is	for	children	i	owe	him	a	debt	tell	me

dreykov's	daughter	s�o	paulo	the	hospital	fire?	barton	told	me	everything	your	ledger	is	dripping	it's	gushing	red	and	you	
think	saving	a	man	no	more	virtuous	than	yourself	will	change	anything?	this	is	the	basest	sentimentality	this	is	a	
child	at	prayer	pathetic	you	lie	and	k*ll	in	the	service	of	liars	and	k*ll	you	pretend	to	be	separate	
to	have	your	own	code	something	that	makes	up	for	the	horrors	but	they	are	part	of	you	and	they	
will	never	go	away	i	won't	touch	barton	not	until	i	make	him	k*ll	you	slowly	intimately	in	every	way	
he	knows	you	fear	and	then	he'll	wake	just	long	enough	to	see	his	good	work	and	when	he	screams

out	there	are	you?	and	you're	not	the	only	threat	the	world's	filling	up	with	people	who	can't	be	matched	
that	can't	be	controlled	like	you	controlled	the	cube?	your	work	with	the	tesseract	is	what	drew	loki	to	it	
and	his	allies	it	is	a	signal	to	all	the	realms	that	the	earth	is	ready	for	a	higher	form	
of	w*r	a	higher	form?	you	forced	our	hand	we	had	to	come	up	with	something	a	nuclear	deterrent	because

and	then	shawarma	after	if	it's	all	the	same	to	you	i'll	have	that	drink	now	despite	the	devastation	of	
what	has	been	confirmed	as	an	extraterrestrial	attack	the	extraordinary	heroics	of	the	group	known	as	the	avengers	has	been	
to	many	a	cause	not	only	for	comfort	but	for	celebration	it's	just	really	great	knowing	they're	out	there	that	
someone	is	watching	over	us	i	love	you	thor	and	then	these	guys	were	like	and	then	the	air	goes	
and	this	green	guy	walks	up	and	he	goes	i	don't	know	i	don't	exactly	feel	safer	with	those	things	
out	there	it	just	seems	that	there's	a	lot	they're	not	telling	us	superheroes	in	new	york?	give	me	a	
break	these	so	called	"heroes"	have	to	be	held	responsible	for	the	destruction	done	to	this	city	this	was	their	
fight	where	are	they	now?	tough	questions	are	being	asked	about	the	avengers	themselves	their	sudden	appearance	and	equally	sudden	
disappearance	what	this	is	all	somehow	their	fault?	captain	america	saved	my	life	wherever	he	is	and	wherever	any	of	
them	are	i	would	just	i	would	want	to	say	thank	you	where	are	the	avengers?	i'm	not	currently	tracking	
their	whereabouts	i'd	say	they've	earned	a	leave	of	absence	and	the	tesseract?	the	tesseract	is	where	it	belongs	out	
of	our	reach	that's	not	your	call	i	didn't	make	it	i	just	didn't	argue	with	the	god	that	did	
so	you	let	him	take	it	and	the	w*r	criminal	loki	who	should	be	answering	for	his	crime	i	think	
he	will	be	i	don't	think	you	understand	what	you've	started	letting	the	avengers	loose	on	this	world	they're	dangerous	
they	surely	are	and	the	whole	world	knows	it	every	world	knows	it	was	that	the	point	of	all	this?	
a	statement?	a	promise	sir	how	does	it	work	now?	they've	gone	their	separate	ways	some	pretty	extremely	far	if	
we	get	into	a	situation	like	this	again	what	happens	then?	they'll	come	back	are	you	really	sure	about	that?	
i	am	why?	because	we'll	need	them	to	humans	they	are	not	the	cowering	wretches	we	were	promised	they	stand	
they	are	unruly	and	therefore	cannot	be	ruled	to	challenge	them
