don't	be	dead	please	where	did	he	come	from?	odin:	once	mankind	accepted	a	simple	truth	that	they	were	not	
alone	in	this	universe	some	worlds	man	believed	to	be	home	to	their	gods	others	they	knew	to	fear	from	
a	realm	of	cold	and	darkness	came	the	frost	giants	(screams)	threatening	to	plunge	the	mortal	world	into	a	new	
ice	age	(roars)	but	humanity	would	not	face	this	threat	alone	(yelling)	our	armies	drove	the	frost	giants	back	into	
the	heart	of	their	own	world	the	cost	was	great	in	the	end	their	king	fell	and	the	source	of	
their	power	was	taken	from	them	with	the	last	great	w*r	ended	we	withdrew	from	the	other	worlds	and	returned	
home	to	the	realm	eternal	asgard	here	we	remain	as	a	beacon	of	hope	shining	out	across	the	stars	and	
though	we	have	fallen	into	man's	myths	and	legends	it	was	asgard	and	its	warriors	that	brought	peace	to	the	
universe	but	the	day	will	come	when	one	of	you	will	have	to	defend	that	peace	do	the	frost	giants	
still	live?	when	i'm	king	i'll	hunt	the	monsters	down	and	slay	them	all	just	as	you	did	father	a	
wise	king	never	seeks	out	w*r	but	he	must	always	be	ready	for	it	i'm	ready	father	so	am	i	
only	one	of	you	can	ascend	to	the	throne	but	both	of	you	were	born	to	be	kings	(all	cheering)	
oh	please	(spear	thudding)	thor	odinson	my	heir	my	firstborn	so	long	entrusted	with	the	mighty	hammer	mjolnir	forged	in	
the	heart	of	a	dying	star	its	power	has	no	equal	as	a	w*apon	to	destroy	or	as	a	tool	
to	build	'tis	a	fit	companion	for	a	king	i	have	defended	asgard	and	the	lives	of	the	innocent	across	
the	nine	realms	from	the	time	of	the	great	beginning	though	the	day	has	come	do	you	swear	to	guard	
the	nine	realms?	i	swear	and	do	you	swear	to	preserve	the	peace?	i	swear	do	you	swear	to	cast	
aside	all	selfish	ambition	and	to	pledge	yourself	only	to	the	good	of	the	realms?	i	swear	then	on	this	
day	i	odin	allfather	proclaim	you	the	frost	giants	(spear	thudding)	thor:	the	jotuns	must	pay	for	what	they've	done	
they	have	paid	with	their	lives	the	destroyer	did	its	work	the	casket	is	safe	and	all	is	well	all	
is	well?	they	broke	into	the	w*apon	vault	if	the	frost	giants	had	stolen	even	one	of	these	relics	they	
didn't	well	i	want	to	know	why	i	have	a	truce	with	laufey	king	of	the	jotuns	he	just	broke	
your	truce	they	know	you	are	vulnerable	what	action	would	you	take?	march	into	jotunheim	as	you	once	did	teach	
them	a	lesson	break	their	spirits	so	they'll	never	dare	try	to	cross	our	borders	again	you're	thinking	only	as	
a	warrior	this	was	an	act	of	w*r	it	was	the	act	of	but	a	few	doomed	to	fail	look	
how	far	they	got	we	will	find	the	breach	in	our	defenses	and	it	will	be	sealed	as	king	of	
asgard	.	but	you're	not	king	not	yer	(roaring)	it's	unwise	to	be	in	my	company	right	now	brother	this	
was	to	be	my	day	of	triumph	it'll	come	in	time	what's	this?	if	it's	any	consolation	i	think	you're	
right	about	the	frost	giants	about	laufey	about	everything	if	they	found	a	way	to	penetrate	asgard's	defenses	once	who's	
to	say	they	won't	try	again?	next	time	with	an	army	exactly	there's	nothing	you	can	do	without	defying	father

be	warned	i	will	honor	my	sworn	oath	to	protect	this	realm	as	its	gatekeeper	if	your	return	threatens	the	
safety	of	asgard	bifrost	will	remain	closed	to	you	and	you'll	be	left	to	die	in	the	cold	waste	of	
jotunheim	volstagg:	couldn't	you	just	leave	the	bridge	open	for	us?	heimdall:	to	leave	the	bridge	open	would	unleash	the
