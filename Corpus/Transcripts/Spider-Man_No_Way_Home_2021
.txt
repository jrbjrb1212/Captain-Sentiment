of	cafkal	oh	it's	just	a	standard	spell	of	forgetting	won't	turn	back	time	but	at	least	people	will	forget	
that	you	were	ever	spider	man.	seriously?	no	not	seriously	that	spell	travels	the	dark	borders	between	known	and	unknown	
reality	it's	too	dangerous	god	we've	used	it	for	a	lot	less	do	you	remember	the	full	moon	party	in	
kamar	taj?	no.	exactly	come	on	wong	hasn't	he	been	through	enough?	just	leave	me	out	of	this	fine	fine

about	to	forget	that	peter	parker	is	spider	man.	including	me.	everyone?	can't	some	people	still	know?	that's	not	how	
the	spell	works	very	difficult	and	dangerous	to	change	it	mid	casting.	so	my	girlfriend	is	just	gonna	forget	about	
everything	we've	been	through?	i	mean	is	she	even	gonna	be	my	girlfriend?	that	depends	was	she	your	girlfriend	just	
because	you're	spider	man,	or	i	don't	know	i	really	hope	not	alright	fine	everyone	in	the	world	is	gonna	
forget	you're	spider	man,	except	your	girlfriend	thank	you	so	much....	oh	my	god	ned	ned!	what	is	a	ned?	
he's	my	best	friend	so	it's	really	important	to	me	that	ned	knows	okay	let's	not	change	the	parameters	of	
the	spell	anymore	while	i'm	casting	it.	okay	i'm	done	i	swear	i'm	done	but	my	aunt	may	should	really	
know	peter	stop	tampering	with	the	spell	once	she	found	out	that	i	was	spider	man,	it	was	really	messy	
and	i	don't	think	that	i	can	go	through	with	that	again	so	my	aunt	may?	yes	oh	thank	you	
happy?	no	i	am	annoyed	no	it's	a	nickname.	harold	"happy"	hogan	he	used	to	work	for	tony	stark	.	
could	you	just	stop	talking?	basically	everyone	who	knew	that	i	was	spider	man	before	should	still	know	did	it	
work?	no	you	changed	my	spell	six	times.	five	times	you	changed	my	spell.	you	don't	do	that	i	told	
you	and	that	is	why	that	spell	was	completely	out	of	control	if	i	hadn't	shut	it	down	something	catastrophic	
could've	happened	stephen	listen	i	am	so	sorry	call	me	sir	sorry	sir	you	know	after	everything	we've	been	through	
together	somehow	i	always	forget	you're	just	a	kid	look	part	of	the	problem	it's	not	mysterio	it's	you	trying

sorry	about	you	and	your	friends	not	getting	into	college	but	if	they	rejected	you	and	you	try	to	convince	
them	to	reconsider	there	is	nothing	else	you	can	do	when	you	say	"convince	them"	you	mean	like	i	could've	
called	them?	yeah	i	can	do	that?	you	haven't	called?	well	i	mean	i	got	their	letter	and	i	assumed

i	contained	it	but	it	would	appear	that	a	few	of	them	squeaked	through	after	you	left	i	detected	an	
otherworldly	presence	i	pursued	it	into	the	sewers	where	i	found	that	slimy	green	son	of	a	g*n	spell?	is	
it	magic?	what	is	this	a	birthday	party?	who	is	this	clown?	what	is	this	madness?	watch	this	do	you
