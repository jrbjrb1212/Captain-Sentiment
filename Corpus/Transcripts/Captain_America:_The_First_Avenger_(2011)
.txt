a	asthmatic	onto	my	army	i	let	it	i	the	maybe	be	useful	to	like	a	i	never	thought	pick	
you	stick	a	needle	in	that	gonna	go	right	through	come	look	at	making	me	i	am	looking	for	qualities	
beyond	the	do	you	know	how	long	it	took	to	set	up	this	all	the	groveling	i	had	to	do	
in	front	of	senator	i	i	am	well	aware	of	your	then	throw	me	a	hodge	passed	every	test	we	
gave	he	obeys	a	he	is	a	you	win	wars	with	you	win	wars	with	get	get	it	was	a	
dummy	all	back	in	is	this	a	still	may	i	got	the	i	can	i	ask	you	a	just	why	
i	suppose	that	is	the	only	question	that	this	is	from	my	so	many	people	forget	that	the	first	country	
the	invaded	was	their	you	after	the	last	my	people	they	felt	they	felt	and	then	comes	along	with	the	
marching	and	the	big	show	and	the	and	he	hears	of	my	and	he	finds	and	he	he	will	make	
us	i	am	not	so	he	sends	the	head	of	his	research	a	brilliant	scientist	by	the	name	of	johann	
schmidt	is	a	member	of	the	inner	and	he	is	he	and	share	a	passion	for	occult	power	and	teutonic	
uses	his	fantasies	to	inspire	his	but	for	it	is	not	for	it	is	he	has	become	convinced	that	there	
is	a	great	power	hidden	in	the	left	here	by	the	waiting	to	be	seized	by	a	superior	so	when	
he	hears	about	my	formula	and	what	it	can	he	cannot	schmidt	must	become	that	superior	did	it	make	him	
but	there	were	other	the	serum	was	not	but	more	the	the	serum	amplifies	everything	that	is	so	good	becomes	
bad	becomes	this	is	why	you	were	because	a	strong	man	who	has	known	power	all	his	life	may	lose	
respect	for	that	but	a	weak	man	knows	the	value	of	and	knows	i	whatever	happens	you	must	promise	me	
one	that	you	will	stay	who	you	not	a	perfect	but	a	good	to	the	little	what	i	am	you	
have	procedure	no	all	drink	it	i	have	procedure	drink	it	i	drink	it	is	there	something	in	particular	you	
i	understand	you	found	see	for	you	i	just	see	why	you	need	concern	i	imagine	he	will	his	serum	
is	the	only	defense	against	this	power	we	now	if	we	take	it	away	from	then	our	victory	is	shall	
i	give	the	it	has	been	what	do	you	a	i	know	this	i	got	up	in	that	and	that	
parking	and	behind	that	did	you	have	something	against	running	you	start	never	let	you	you	stand	you	push	they	
say	no	i	know	a	little	of	what	to	have	every	door	shut	in	your	i	guess	i	just	know	
why	want	to	join	the	army	if	you	were	a	beautiful	or	a	an	not	a	you	are	you	have	
no	idea	how	to	talk	to	a	do	i	think	this	is	the	longest	conversation	had	with	women	exactly	lining	
up	to	dance	with	a	guy	they	might	step	you	must	have	asking	a	woman	to	dance	always	seemed	so	
and	the	past	few	it	just	seem	to	matter	that	i	figured	for	the	right	this	what	are	we	doing	
follow	wonderful	weather	this	but	i	always	carry	an	good	not	are	you	take	off	your	your	and	your	senator	
glad	you	could	make	why	exactly	am	i	in	we	needed	access	to	the	power	of	if	given	me	the	
generators	i	a	lot	of	people	are	asking	for	this	fred	state	if	this	project	of	yours	comes	like	to	
see	it	used	for	something	other	than	somebody	get	that	kid	a	a	little	you	save	me	any	of	that	
not	as	much	as	i	should	next	how	are	your	levels	at	we	may	dim	half	the	lights	in	but	
we	are	ready	as	ever	agent	you	think	you	would	be	more	comfortable	in	the	of	do	you	hear	is	
this	ladies	and	today	we	take	not	another	step	towards	but	the	first	step	on	the	path	to	we	begin	
with	a	series	of	microinjections	into	the	major	muscle	the	serum	infusion	will	cause	immediate	cellular	and	to	stimulate	the	
subject	will	be	saturated	with	that	so	that	was	serum	infusion	beginning	in	can	you	hear	probably	too	late	to	
go	to	the	we	will	twenty	vital	signs	are	shut	it	shut	it	the	turn	it	the	i	can	do	
the	son	of	a	bitch	did	i	did	i	think	we	did	you	actually	did	how	do	you	you	look	
how	do	you	like	brooklyn	i	can	think	of	some	folks	in	berlin	who	are	about	to	get	very	thank	
stop	what	are	you	are	you	all	this	been	i	had	not	my	stop	hurt	get	let	me	let	go	
of	my	hurt	go	get	i	can	who	the	hell	are	the	first	of	cut	off	one	two	more	shall	
take	its	hail	the	is	not	accustomed	to	being	herr	he	funds	your	research	because	you	promised	him	you	serve	
at	his	he	gave	you	this	facility	as	a	reward	for	your	call	it	what	it	i	no	longer	reflect	
his	image	of	aryan	you	think	this	is	about	your	hydra	division	has	failed	to	deliver	so	much	as	a

put	red	skull	has	been	indulged	long	you	have	come	to	see	the	results	of	our	let	me	show	speaks	
of	a	but	he	cannot	feed	his	armies	for	a	his	troops	spill	their	across	every	field	in	but	still	
he	is	no	closer	to	achieving	his	and	i	suppose	you	still	aim	to	win	this	through	but	i	understand	
your	great	power	has	always	baffled	primitive	hydra	is	assembling	an	arsenal	to	destroy	my	enemies	in	one	wherever	they	
regardless	of	how	many	forces	they	all	in	a	matter	of	your	my	contain	enough	destructive	power	to	decimate	every	
hostile	capital	on	quite	i	have	harnessed	the	power	of	the	thank	for	for	making	it	clear	how	obviously	mad	
you	berlin	is	on	this	so	it	you	will	be	punished	for	your	you	will	be	brought	before	the	my	
but	we	both	knew	hydra	could	grow	no	further	in	hail	hail	hail	think	you	got	any	hope	of	reproducing	
the	program	is	locked	in	your	genetic	but	without	it	would	take	he	deserved	more	than	if	it	could	work
