more	than	just	thinking	about	it	he	is	the	clear	choice	when	you	brought	a	90	pound	asthmatic	onto	my	army	base	i	let	it	slide	i	thought	"what	the	hell	"	maybe	he'd	be	useful	to	you	like	a	
gerbil	i	never	thought	you'd	pick	him	up	you	stick	a	needle	in	that	kid's	arm	it's	gonna	go	right	through	him	come	on	girls	look	at	that	he's	making	me	cry	i	am	looking	for	qualities	beyond	the	physical	
do	you	know	how	long	it	took	to	set	up	this	project?	all	the	groveling	i	had	to	do	in	front	of	senator	what's	his	name's	committees?	brandt	yes	i	know	i	am	well	aware	of	your	efforts	then	throw	
me	a	bone	hodge	passed	every	test	we	gave	him	he's	big	he's	fast	he	obeys	orders	he's	a	soldier	he	is	a	bully	you	don't	win	wars	with	niceness	doctor	you	win	wars	with	guts	grenade	get	away	get	
back	it	was	a	dummy	grenade	all	clear	back	in	formation	is	this	a	test?	he's	still	skinny	may	i?	yeah	can't	sleep?	i	got	the	jitters	i	guess	me	too	can	i	ask	you	a	question?	just	one?	why	
me?	i	suppose	that	is	the	only	question	that	matters	this	is	from	augsburg	my	city	so	many	people	forget	that	the	first	country	the	n*zi	invaded	was	their	own	you	know	after	the	last	w*r	my	people	struggled	they	
felt	weak	they	felt	small	and	then	h*tler	comes	along	with	the	marching	and	the	big	show	and	the	flags	and	he	hears	of	me	my	work	and	he	finds	me	and	he	says	"you	"	he	says	"you	will	
make	us	strong	"	well	i	am	not	interested	so	he	sends	the	head	of	hydra	his	research	division	a	brilliant	scientist	by	the	name	of	johann	schmidt	now	schmidt	is	a	member	of	the	inner	circle	and	he	is	
ambitious	he	and	h*tler	share	a	passion	for	occult	power	and	teutonic	myth	h*tler	uses	his	fantasies	to	inspire	his	followers	but	for	schmidt	it	is	not	fantasy	for	him	it	is	real	he	has	become	convinced	that	there	is	
a	great	power	hidden	in	the	earth	left	here	by	the	gods	waiting	to	be	seized	by	a	superior	man	so	when	he	hears	about	my	formula	and	what	it	can	do	he	cannot	resist	schmidt	must	become	that	superior	
man	did	it	make	him	stronger?	yes	but	there	were	other	effects	the	serum	was	not	ready	but	more	important	the	man	the	serum	amplifies	everything	that	is	inside	so	good	becomes	great	bad	becomes	worse	this	is	why	you	
were	chosen	because	a	strong	man	who	has	known	power	all	his	life	may	lose	respect	for	that	power	but	a	weak	man	knows	the	value	of	strength	and	knows	compassion	thanks	i	think	whatever	happens	tomorrow	you	must	promise	
me	one	thing	that	you	will	stay	who	you	are	not	a	perfect	soldier	but	a	good	man	to	the	little	guys	no	no	wait	wait	what	i	am	doing?	no	you	have	procedure	tomorrow	no	fluids	all	right	we'll	
drink	it	after	no	i	don't	have	procedure	tomorrow	drink	it	after?	i	drink	it	now	is	there	something	in	particular	you	need?	i	understand	you	found	him	see	for	yourself	you	disapprove	i	just	don't	see	why	you	need	
concern	yourself	i	can't	imagine	he	will	succeed	again	his	serum	is	the	allies'	only	defense	against	this	power	we	now	possess	if	we	take	it	away	from	them	then	our	victory	is	assured	shall	i	give	the	order?	it	
has	been	given	good	dr	zola	what	do	you	think?	a	masterpiece	i	know	this	neighborhood	i	got	b*at	up	in	that	alley	and	that	parking	lot	and	behind	that	diner	did	you	have	something	against	running	away?	you	start	
running	they'll	never	let	you	stop	you	stand	up	you	push	back	they	can't	say	no	forever	right?	i	know	a	little	of	what	that's	like	to	have	every	door	shut	in	your	face	i	guess	i	just	don't	know	
why	you'd	want	to	join	the	army	if	you	were	a	beautiful	dame	or	a	a	woman	an	agent	not	a	dame	you	are	beautiful	but	you	have	no	idea	how	to	talk	to	a	woman	do	you?	i	think	
this	is	the	longest	conversation	i've	had	with	one	women	aren't	exactly	lining	up	to	dance	with	a	guy	they	might	step	on	you	must	have	danced	well	asking	a	woman	to	dance	always	seemed	so	terrifying	and	the	past	
few	years	it	just	didn't	seem	to	matter	that	much	i	figured	i'd	wait	for	what?	the	right	partner	this	way	what	are	we	doing	here?	follow	me	wonderful	weather	this	morning	isn't	it?	yes	but	i	always	carry	an	
umbrella	good	morning	please	not	now	are	you	ready?	good	take	off	your	shirt	your	tie	and	your	hat	senator	brandt	glad	you	could	make	it	why	exactly	am	i	in	brooklyn?	we	needed	access	to	the	city's	power	grid	
of	course	if	you'd	given	me	the	generators	i	requisitioned	a	lot	of	people	are	asking	for	funds	colonel	this	is	fred	clemson	state	department	if	this	project	of	yours	comes	through	we'd	like	to	see	it	used	for	something	
other	than	headlines	jesus	somebody	get	that	kid	a	sandwich	comfortable?	it's	a	little	big	you	save	me	any	of	that	schnapps?	not	as	much	as	i	should	have	sorry	next	time	mr	stark	how	are	your	levels?	levels	at	
100%	good	we	may	dim	half	the	lights	in	brooklyn	but	we	are	ready	as	we'll	ever	be	agent	carter?	don't	you	think	you	would	be	more	comfortable	in	the	booth?	yes	of	course	sorry	good	do	you	hear	me?	
is	this	on?	ladies	and	gentlemen	today	we	take	not	another	step	towards	annihilation	but	the	first	step	on	the	path	to	peace	we	begin	with	a	series	of	microinjections	into	the	subject's	major	muscle	groups	the	serum	infusion	will	
cause	immediate	cellular	change	and	then	to	stimulate	growth	the	subject	will	be	saturated	with	vita	rays.	that	wasn't	so	bad	that	was	penicillin	serum	infusion	beginning	in	five	four	three	two	one	now	mr	stark	steven?	can	you	hear	
me?	it's	probably	too	late	to	go	to	the	bathroom	right?	we	will	proceed	that's	10%	twenty	percent	thirty	that's	40%	vital	signs	are	normal	that's	50%	sixty	seventy	steven	steven	shut	it	down	shut	it	down	k*ll	the	reactor	
mr	stark	turn	it	off	k*ll	it	k*ll	the	reactor	no	don't	i	can	do	this	eighty	ninety	that's	100%	mr	stark?	steven	steven	the	son	of	a	bitch	did	it	i	did	it	yeah	yeah	i	think	we	did	
it	you	actually	did	it	how	do	you	feel?	taller	you	look	taller	how	do	you	like	brooklyn	now	senator?	i	can	think	of	some	folks	in	berlin	who	are	about	to	get	very	nervous	congratulations	doctor	thank	you	sir	
stop	him	what	are	you	doing?	buddy	are	you	all	right?	hey	this	guy's	been	sh*t	i	had	him	sorry	i'm	sorry	no	no	not	my	son	stop	it	don't	hurt	him	get	back	let	me	go	let	go	of

not	accustomed	to	being	ignored	herr	schmidt	he	funds	your	research	because	you	promised	him	w*apon	you	serve	at	his	pleasure	he	gave	you	this	facility	as	a	reward	for	your	injuries	reward?	call	it	what	it	is	exile	i	
no	longer	reflect	his	image	of	aryan	perfection	you	think	this	is	about	appearances?	your	hydra	division	has	failed	to	deliver	so	much	as	a	r*fle	in	over	a	year	and	we	had	learned	through	local	intelligence	you	had	mounted	
a	full	scale	incursion	into	norway	the	f�hrer	feels	how	does	he	put	it?	"the	red	skull	has	been	indulged	long	enough	"	gentlemen	you	have	come	to	see	the	results	of	our	work	let	me	show	you	h*tler	speaks	
of	a	1,000	year	reich	but	he	cannot	feed	his	armies	for	a	month	his	troops	spill	their	bl*od	across	every	field	in	europe	but	still	he	is	no	closer	to	achieving	his	goals	and	i	suppose	you	still	aim	
to	win	this	w*r	through	magic?	science	but	i	understand	your	confusion	great	power	has	always	baffled	primitive	men	hydra	is	assembling	an	arsenal	to	destroy	my	enemies	in	one	stroke	wherever	they	are	regardless	of	how	many	forces	they	
possess	all	in	a	matter	of	hours	your	enemies?	my	w*apon	contain	enough	destructive	power	to	decimate	every	hostile	capital	on	earth	quite	simply	gentlemen	i	have	harnessed	the	power	of	the	gods	thank	you	schmidt	for	what?	for	making	
it	clear	how	obviously	mad	you	are	berlin	is	on	this	map	so	it	is	you	will	be	punished	for	your	insolence	you	will	be	brought	before	the	f�hrer	himself	schmidt	my	apologies	doctor	but	we	both	knew	hydra	could	
grow	no	further	in	h*tler's	shadow	hail	hydra	hail	hydra	hail	hydra	think	you	got	enough?	any	hope	of	reproducing	the	program	is	locked	in	your	genetic	code	but	without	dr	erskine	it	would	take	years	he	deserved	more	than	
this	if	it	could	work	only	once	he'd	be	proud	it	was	you	colonel	phillips	my	committee	is	demanding	answers	great	why	don't	we	start	with	how	a	german	spy	got	a	ride	to	my	secret	installation	in	your	car?

you've	been	reading	our	briefings	i'm	on	a	number	of	committees	colonel	hydra	is	the	n*zi	deep	science	division	it's	led	by	johann	schmidt	but	he	has	much	bigger	ambitions	hydra	is	practically	a	cult	they	worship	schmidt	they	think	
he's	invincible	so	what	are	you	going	to	do	about	it?	i	spoke	to	the	president	this	morning	as	of	today	the	ssr	is	being	retasked	colonel?	we	are	taking	the	fight	to	hydra	pack	your	bags	agent	carter	you
